# PX428-Ising-Model-Simulation
A c implementation of the metropolis algorithm to simulate the behavior of materials around the critical temperature.

This is a c adapation of the MATLAB Simulation 'PX428 Physics Laboratory - Ising Model Simulations' by Lewis Mosby 02/03/2020-19/08/2020, which was orignially inspired by the Mathworks Ising Model and Metropolis Algorithm code found here: https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/62194-ising-model-and-metropolis-algorithm. Copyright 2017 The MathWorks, Inc.
I would also like to provide credit to the GNU Scientfic Library Manual for its extensive information and example code snipets on implementing thier random number generation libary : M. G. et al, GNU Scientific Libary Reference Manual, Vol. 3rd Ed. (ISBN 0954612078) .

Finally this code was put together very quickly in order to meet a dealine. As a result I have not have time to remove code dupliation or create an elegant link to the heatmap plotter code.
